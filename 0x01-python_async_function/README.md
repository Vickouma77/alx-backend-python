# 0x01-python_async_function

## Learning Objectives
### General

* async and await syntax
* How to execute an async program with asyncio
* How to run concurrent coroutines
* How to create asyncio tasks
* How to use the random module
* How to write an asynchronous generator
* How to use async comprehensions
* How to type-annotate generators

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
* All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Tasks
| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. The basics of async](./0-basic_async_syntax.py) | Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (max_delay, with a default value of 10) named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.  |
| [1-concurrent_coroutines.py](./1-concurrent_coroutines.py) | Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written and write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay. wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values). The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using sort() because of concurrency.  |
| [2-measure_runtime.py](./2-measure_runtime.py) | Import wait_n from the previous file and write a measure_time function with integers n and max_delay as arguments that measures the total execution time for wait_n(n, max_delay), and returns total_time / n. Your function should return a float.  |
| [3-tasks.py](./3-tasks.py) | Import wait_random from 0-basic_async_syntax. Write a function (do not create an async function, use the regular function syntax to do this) task_wait_random that takes an integer max_delay and returns a asyncio.Task.  |
| [4-tasks.py](./4-tasks.py) | Take the code from wait_n and alter it into a new function task_wait_n. The code is nearly identical to wait_n except task_wait_random is being called.  |
