# 0x02-python_async_comprehension

## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* How to write an asynchronous generator
* How to use async comprehensions
* How to type-annotate generators

---

### [0. Async Generator](./0-async_generator.py)
* Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments.


### [1. Async Comprehensions](./1-async_comprehension.py)
* Import async_generator from the previous task and then write a coroutine called async_comprehension that takes no arguments.


### [2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions](./2-measure_runtime.py)
* Import async_comprehension from the previous file and write a measure_runtime coroutine that will execute async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather.
